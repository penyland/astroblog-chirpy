# Hi, I'm Peter Nylander
I'm a software engineer and a solution architect focusing on Microsoft technologies, but I have always had a passion for .NET development and Microsoft Azure Cloud. I have over 20 years of experience in the software industry, working on various projects and platforms. I'm passionate about technology and always eager to learn new things. The last five years I have also developed an interest in Devops, CI/CD, build automation and cloud infrastructure.

On my spare time I like to spend time with my family and friends. Watch movies, play video games, watch ice hockey and go skiing. My favorite team is [Fr√∂lunda Hockey Club](https://www.frolundahockey.com/)! Go FHC!
I'm also interested in good food, wine and beer!

I also organize a .NET user group in my hometown amongst other things. Check out the [user group](https://www.meetup.com/net-skane/) if you are interested in .NET development and live in the area.

In my job I focus on technical solutions and researching new technologies! This is what I love to do and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and develop my skills. 

On this blog I will write about my thoughts and ideas about software development and architecture. I will also share some of my projects and code snippets and what I have learned from on the way. 
I write this blog for myself as a way to document and remember what I have learned and to share my knowledge with others.

I hope you will find something interesting here and that you will come back for more!
